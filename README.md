This is a webpage dedicated to making the process of getting healthier easier. this is a simple SPA built in react and you can recreate this easily.
I am using a workout API from https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises
i have left some sample code in the index.js file where you can find out more imformation about the api and how to get your own access key.
i created a workout builder where you can select from a dropdown multiple options and it will generate an exercise ruitiune based on the options you selected.
it makes the process easy and simple for any beginner to persue their fitness journey.
